homebase
========
Based off of: https://github.com/benbernard/HomeDir
I've minimized the features I want, and configured it for the "fish" shell


Installation
========
Requires brew or some other means of installing fish:
```
% brew install fish
% cd ~
% git clone git@github.com:gremsam/homebase.git
% mv ~/homebase/* ~
% mv ~/homebase/.git ~
```
